# kattis-solutions

Kattis is a website featuring problems for student to solve using programming.  The solutions are evaluated (executed) automatically online, by runnning them with a series of test cases, within a time limit.

Most of the solutions was written when I took the course "INF237 - Algorithms Engineering" at the University of Bergen spring 2018.

All solutions are written by the owner of this repository, Sindre Følling Sørensen. Please do not copy my code or solutions, but feel free to learn from it, get inspiration and use small snippits of it.
